# We need to build a model that is able to take in a csv file/ data input of health parameters such as blood glucose. insulin, pressure to be able to predict whether 
the individual has diabettis or not. 

# The product needs to be able to have an accuracy of raning from 75%- 85% to be viable
# The product needs to be self trained and needs to be able to produce results based on both test and trained data sets

# The dataframe needs to be processed to be able to be read by the machine learning algorithm used so that there is standardization in the values recorded
for the patients
